## Biography

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM) in Paris, within the [Networks and Internet of Things Systems (ROC Team)](https://roc.cedric.cnam.fr/).

My research sits at the intersection of **networked distributed systems**, **optimization**, and **data stream management**. Currently, my work focuses on:
* **In-Network Distributed Learning:** Designing and optimizing data pipeline systems to support AI within operator networks.
* **Edge-Cloud Continuum:** Scheduling both AI-based and classic applications using a mix of traditional optimization techniques and **Reinforcement Learning**.
